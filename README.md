# Nifty-Prediction
## Nifty Price Prediction using LSTM

This project aims to predict the closing price of the NIFTY 50 index using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The dataset spans from 2000 to 2024 and is downloaded from the official NSE website.

### Key Features

* Utilizes LSTM architecture for time series prediction.
* Leverages data from 2000 to 2024, incorporating long-term trends.
* Downloads data directly from the NSE website for transparency and ease of update.

### Getting Started

Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/LuniaKunal/Nifty-Prediction`

### Project Structure

* `data`: Stores the downloaded NIFTY data.
* `models`: Contains trained LSTM models and weights.
* `src`: Houses all Python scripts for data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and prediction.
* `README.md`: This file (you are reading it now!).
* `requirements.txt`: Lists all required Python libraries.
